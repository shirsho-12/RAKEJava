# RAKEJava
A Java15 Implementation of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction Framework ( RAKE ) for keyword extraction. This is a completely self-contained implementation not using any external models such as the Illinois POS tagger.

The Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm is as described in: Rose, S., Engel, D., Cramer, N., & Cowley, W. (2010). Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents. In M. W. Berry & J. Kogan (Eds.), Text Mining: Theory and Applications: John Wiley & Sons.

The implementation follows from https://github.com/aneesha/RAKE 's Python3 model. The source code is released under the MIT License.
